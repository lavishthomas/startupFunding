This technical project aims to provide insights into the investment of the start-ups based on data from 1995 to 2015 using the various techniques which are provided in the Apache Spark Ecosystem. Initially, data cleaning is done using transformation functions provided by Apache Spark Dataframe. Furthermore, SQL data analysis is performed in which metrics like top categories are derived. Subsequently, the supervised machine learning algorithm of Linear regression is used in order to find the fastest growing sectors and predict the investment for the year 2020. Afterwards, based on the growth and stability factors of investments, new stereotypes are derived using unsupervised learning algorithm of K Means. A distribution pie chart is also provided for new stereotypes. Finally, a summary chart prepared about all the techniques and their use cases used in this project
