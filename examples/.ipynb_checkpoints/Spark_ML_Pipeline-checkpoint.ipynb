    "# Spark ML model pipelines on Distributed Deep Neural Nets\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to build machine learning [pipelines with Spark ML](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html) for distributed versions of Keras deep learning models. As data set we use the Otto Product Classification challenge from Kaggle. The reason we chose this data is that it is small and very structured. This way, we can focus more on technical components rather than prepcrocessing intricacies. Also, users with slow hardware or without a full-blown Spark cluster should be able to run this example locally, and still learn a lot about the distributed mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the need to distribute computation is not imposed by model training, but rather by building the data pipeline, i.e. ingestion, transformation etc. In training, deep neural networks tend to do fairly well on one or more GPUs on one machine. Most of the time, using gradient descent methods, you will process one batch after another anyway. Even so, it may still be beneficial to use frameworks like Spark to integrate your models with your surrounding infrastructure. On top of that, the convenience provided by Spark ML pipelines can be very valuable (being syntactically very close to what you might know from [```scikit-learn```](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR:** We will show how to tackle a classification problem using distributed deep neural nets and Spark ML pipelines in an example that is essentially a distributed version of the one found [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/kaggle_otto_nn.py)."

We can not plug in keras models into the ```Estimator``` directly, as Spark will have to serialize them anyway for communication with workers, so it's better to provide the serialization ourselves. In fact, while pyspark knows how to serialize ```model```, it is extremely inefficient and can break if models become too large. Spark ML is especially picky (and rightly so) about parameters and more or less prohibits you from providing non-atomic types and arrays of the latter. Most of the remaining parameters are optional and rather self explainatory. Plus, many of them you know if you have ever run a keras model before.
